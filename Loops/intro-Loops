üîÑ What is a loop?
----------------------------------
A loop is used to repeat something again and again.
if we wnat to write something for multiple times we use loops
 loops are 3 types 
    1Ô∏è‚É£ for loop ,2Ô∏è‚É£ while loop , 3Ô∏è‚É£ Do while loop .

1Ô∏è‚É£ for loop
-------------
if we menthion particualr times to repeat a particual task
we use this for loop .

    EX:   for i in range(5):
            print(i)

out put:   0 1 2 3 4 5

2Ô∏è‚É£ while loop
----------------
we repeat the task the until the condition is ture 
EX:        i = 0
      while i < 5:
        print(i)
         i += 1

out put:    0 1 2 3 4

3Ô∏è‚É£ Do while loop
--------------------
when we run the block of the code it will run for first time 
then its will check the condition ,if the the conditon id true 
the code will run or its flase its don't run

EX:       while True:
    print("Hello Niranjan")   # do this first
    user_input = input("Do you want to continue? (yes/no): ")
    if user_input.lower() != "yes":
        break
