## What is Conditions ?
 conditions are used to control the flow of a program based on whether a statement is true or false.
They rely on conditional statements like if, elif, and else. Here's a simple example:


    x = 10

    if x > 5:  # Condition: Is x greater than 5?
        print("x is greater than 5")
    elif x == 5:  # Condition: Is x equal to 5?
        print("x is equal to 5")
    else:  # Executes if none of the above conditions are true
        print("x is less than 5")       


In this example:
- If the condition x > 5 is true, it prints "x is greater than 5."
- If the condition x == 5 is true, it prints "x is equal to 5."
- If neither condition is true, it defaults to else.
